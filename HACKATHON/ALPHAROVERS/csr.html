                    <p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR, also called corporate conscience, corporate citizenship or sustainable responsible business/ Responsible Business)is a form of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model. CSR policy functions as a self-regulatory mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards and international norms. With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance and engages in "actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law."CSR aims to embrace responsibility for corporate actions and to encourage a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others.</p>

                        <br>
                        </h2>
                    <p>As mentioned earlier about corporate social responsibility, current times don’t allow for companies to simply be in business for the sake of making a profit anymore. While consumers may rely on corporations for goods and services, the level of competition allows customers to make decisions based on several factors, including (maybe surprisingly) how much good a corporation is also doing outside of the workplace. Many individuals today are basing their corporate loyalties on how companies are positively impacting their community.</p>

                    <h2>A Better Public Image:

                        <br>
                        
                    </h2>
                    <p>A corporation’s public image is at the mercy of it’s social responsibility programs and how aware consumers are of them (remember, this is the biggest obstacle – education and awareness)! According to a study by Cone Communications, 9 out of 10 consumers would refrain from doing business with a corporation if there existed no corporate social responsibility plan.For example, if a company is heavily involved in the practice of donating funds or goods to local nonprofit organizations and schools, this increases the likelihood that a consumer will use their product. Additionally, if a corporation takes great care to ensure the materials used in its products are environmentally safe and the process is sustainable, this goes a long way in the eye of the public.
